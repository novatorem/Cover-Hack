    `I've gone ahead and created a sample cover letter for you. You can create your own or access the sample by clicking the hamburger menu on the top left corner of the page.

For a quick guide, you can create input forms with {_}.

Selectors can be created with {this/that/or anything else}.

To create paragraph selectors, use:

{*}

But to create paragraphs themselves, you can set them up like the end of this text.
They're then hidden and accessible only from the paragraph selector!

Treat this as you would MarkDown, then edit the final version and copy it to your clipboard.

If you have any questions, comments, or issues, please open a story on github.
